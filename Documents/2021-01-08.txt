1. Today I brush up basic JavaScript conceps as I already gone through JavaScript earlier while making several projects.

2. I brush up on basic js concepts like variable, operator, operator precedence, type mutation, type coercion and everything which is included in today's video session of js.

3. Then I performed excercises related to js, which I pushed into 'coding/js' folder of github.

4. After that I brush up all HTML tags, like table,flex-box, float.

5. And then did html excercise which is assigned to us to perform today.
